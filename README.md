I created an Instagram post using HTML and CSS to improve my skills in web design. It was a great way to practice the layout and working with HTML and CSS properties and tags.
By designing an Instagram post, I learned how to structure the content using HTML tags, and style it using CSS properties. This helped me gain a better understanding of how to create visually appealing and engaging layouts on a web page.

Overall, it was a fun and rewarding project that helped me develop my skills in web design, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my abilities.

This project was part of my coursework at 4Geeks Academy, where I learned web development
